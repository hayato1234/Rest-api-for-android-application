# Rest-api-for-android-application
This project is based on a webpage "How to create REST API for Android app using PHP, Slim and MySQL" by Ravi Tamada
link: (https://www.androidhive.info/2014/01/how-to-create-rest-api-for-android-app-using-php-slim-and-mysql-day-12-2/)

The webpage uses older version of Slim, and this project uses Slim3.

You need to change the password in include/Config.php (where 'your pass').

There is also an android application for using this rest api.
